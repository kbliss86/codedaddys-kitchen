# .gitignore Files

Make sure you always include a proper .gitignore file for your git repos before you commit anything to your repo. For Visual Studio, you will want to include the one found here:

https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/VisualStudio.gitignore

When you open the link, click on the "Raw" button.

1. Place the file with the exact name ```.gitignore``` in the same folder that your solution .sln file sits. 
2. Always add the .gitignore file itself to your repo.

You will also need a .gitignore file in the top of your angular folder; however, that gets created automatically and you won't need to add it.
