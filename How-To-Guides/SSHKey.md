# Creating an SSH Key and Linking it to GitHub

This guide will walk you through the steps to create an SSH key and link it to your GitHub account for secure authentication. Using SSH keys makes it easy to push and pull code securely without needing to type in your GitHub credentials repeatedly.

## Step 1: Check for Existing SSH Keys

Before creating a new SSH key, it's a good idea to check if you already have one on your computer. Follow these steps:

1. **Open Git Bash**: This is a terminal you can use to run Git commands.
2. **Check for Existing Keys**:
   ```bash
   ls -al ~/.ssh
   ```
   This command will list the files in your `.ssh` directory, if it exists. Look for files named `id_rsa.pub`, `id_ecdsa.pub`, or `id_ed25519.pub`. These are existing SSH keys.

   If you see no files or receive an error indicating the `.ssh` directory doesn't exist, you don't have an SSH key yet. Continue to the next step to generate a new key.

For more information, refer to [Checking for existing SSH keys](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/checking-for-existing-ssh-keys).

## Step 2: Generate a New SSH Key

If you don't already have an SSH key, follow these steps to create one:

1. **Open Git Bash**.
2. **Generate the SSH Key**:
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
   ```
   Replace `your_email@example.com` with the email address associated with your GitHub account. If your system doesn't support the `ed25519` algorithm, you can use RSA:
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
   ```
3. When prompted to "Enter a file in which to save the key," press **Enter** to accept the default location. You may also specify a custom name if you prefer.
4. At the prompt, type a **secure passphrase** (optional). This adds an additional layer of security to your SSH key.

For more information, refer to [Generating a new SSH key and adding it to the ssh-agent](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent).

## Step 3: Add Your SSH Key to the SSH Agent

The SSH agent helps manage your keys and remembers your passphrase so you don't have to enter it each time.

1. **Start the SSH Agent**:
   - Open a new admin elevated PowerShell window and run:
     ```powershell
     Get-Service -Name ssh-agent | Set-Service -StartupType Manual
     Start-Service ssh-agent
     ```

2. **Add Your SSH Key to the Agent**:
   - In a regular (non-admin) terminal, run:
     ```bash
     ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
     ```
     Replace `id_ed25519` with the name of your private key if it differs.

## Step 4: Add the SSH Key to Your GitHub Account

Now that you've generated and added your SSH key to the agent, you need to add it to GitHub.

1. **Copy the Public Key to Your Clipboard**:
   ```bash
   clip < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
   ```
   If the `clip` command isn't available, you can manually open the file in a text editor and copy its contents.

2. **Add the Key to GitHub**:
   - Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and log in.
   - In the top-right corner, click your profile photo, then click **Settings**.
   - In the "Access" section of the sidebar, click **SSH and GPG keys**.
   - Click **New SSH key** or **Add SSH key**.
   - **Title**: Add a descriptive title for your key (e.g., "Personal laptop").
   - **Key**: Paste your public key.
   - Click **Add SSH key**.

For more information, refer to [Adding a new SSH key to your GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account).

## Step 5: Test Your SSH Connection

To verify that everything is working correctly, run the following command in Git Bash:

```bash
ssh -T git@github.com
```

If this is your first time connecting, you'll be asked if you want to continue connecting. Type **yes**. You should see a message like:

```
Hi username! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
```

Congratulations! You've successfully linked your SSH key to your GitHub account.

## Troubleshooting
- **Permission Denied (Public Key)**: Ensure your SSH key was added to GitHub and that you're using the correct key by running `ssh-add -l` to list the keys currently added to your SSH agent.
- **Passphrase Issues**: If you're prompted for a passphrase repeatedly, ensure that your SSH agent is running and that you've added your key to it.
