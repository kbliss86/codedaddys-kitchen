# Deploy to Netlify

This guide will help you deploy a project to Netlify using the "Deploy to Netlify" button. For more details, you can refer to the [Netlify Get Started Guide](https://docs.netlify.com/get-started/).

## Steps to Deploy a Project

### 1. Use the "Deploy to Netlify" Button
- Click on the **Deploy to Netlify** button available in the project repository.
- You will be redirected to the Netlify app to create a new site.
- On this page, you will need to connect to GitHub to proceed.

### 2. Connect to GitHub
- Click **Connect to GitHub** to authenticate your GitHub account. If you do not have a Netlify account yet, one will be created as part of this process.

### 3. Save & Deploy
- Select **Save & Deploy** to create the site on Netlify.
- This process will also clone the demo project repository to your GitHub account, allowing you to make your own changes later.
- You will be redirected to the **Deploy details** page in the Netlify UI, where you can track the deployment progress.
- To confirm the repository was created, select **HEAD** to navigate to the newly created repository on GitHub.

### 4. Open Production Deploy
- Once the deployment succeeds, you will receive a production URL where you can access your deployed site.
- Select **Open production deploy** to visit your live website.

### 5. Customize the Site URL
- To customize the site URL, go to **Site configuration > Site details > Site information** in the Netlify UI and change the site name as desired.

### Next Steps
- With your site deployed and a public URL generated, you can make changes to the code to further customize your site and explore more helpful Netlify features.
